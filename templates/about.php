            <h1>Who are we?</h1>
            <p>Include her is an online community where people with the same interest of coding can socialize, 
            learn and inspire each other. It doesn't matter if you are a girl, a boy or another gender, 
            anyone is welcome but unlikely many other coding communities, most of our members are girls. 
            And we love that, because we need to inspire more girls to code. 
            <br><br>
            Include her was founded by Madeleine Westerstrom during her last semester of university. Madeleine studied 
            a bachelor of IT and was struggling to find other girls into coding, this is where the idea of Include her came from. 
            <br><br>
            Include her is a place where no question in our forum is a stupid question, our members are excited about helping each 
            other, whatever level of coding you're at. To make it easier for our members to meet up and make friends, we have a 
            social section where anyone can arrange meetups, small as large. 
            <br><br>
            Include her always aims to improve and add features our members miss. If you have some feedback, suggestions or questions. 
            Please don't hesitate to get in touch. <a href="#">connect ></a></p>
